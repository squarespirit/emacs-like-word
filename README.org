* Emacs config
This is my personal Emacs config. I changed a lot of the keybindings to be like IntelliJ or VScode. This is because the default Emacs keybinds give me hand pain.

Here I'll explain some of the design of the config.
** Editing
*** CUA mode & clipboard
CUA mode is used just because it is too familiar. This helps avoid shellshock when switching from other apps.

This causes lots of key conflicts, but it is possible to work around many of them. The C-x/C-c maps are also available through some function keys.

If you miss the feature from other editors that C-x and C-c cut/copy the whole line when nothing is selected, that is available on C-y/M-y.

| Key   | Map                              | Reason/inspiration | Overrides | Instead use |
|-------+----------------------------------+--------------------+-----------+-------------|
| C-x   | Cut                              | cua-mode           | C-x map   | C-S-x, F5   |
| C-c   | Copy                             | cua-mode           | C-c map   | C-S-c, F6   |
| F5    | C-x map even when mark is active |                    |           |             |
| F6    | C-c map even when mark is active |                    |           |             |
| C-v   | Paste (major modes can override) | cua-mode           | Page down | PgDn        |
| C-S-v | Paste as plain text              |                    |           |             |
| M-v   | Browse kill ring                 |                    | Page up   | PgUp        |
| C-y   | Kill whole line                  | IntelliJ           | Yank      | C-v         |
| M-y   | Copy whole line                  |                    | Yank pop  | M-v         |
*** Undo
| Key   | Map                 | Reason/inspiration | Overrides | Instead use |
|-------+---------------------+--------------------+-----------+-------------|
| C-z   | Undo                | cua-mode           | Suspend   | Nil         |
| C-S-z | Redo                | Many apps          |           |             |
| C-M-z | Visualize undo tree |                    |           |             |

*** ESC
ESC is rebound to C-g so it has the familiar meaning of quitting. Unless you have a broken Alt key, you shouldn't use Esc to hit Alt. However, this probably means that terminal Emacs is probably broken.

*** Other basic shortcuts
C-f is bound mainly out of muscle memory.
| Key       | Map                       | Reason/inspiration        | Overrides      | Instead use |
|-----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+----------------+-------------|
| C-f       | Find (w/ Swiper)          | Many apps                 | Next char      | Arrow keys  |
| M-Spc     | Set mark                  | More ergonomic than C-Spc | Just one space | None        |
| C-w/C-S-w | Expand/contract region    | IntelliJ                  | Cut            | C-x         |
| S-return  | Insert line below         | IntelliJ                  |                |             |
| C-k       | Kill to eol or whole line |                           |                |             |
| C-/       | Comment                   | IntelliJ/VScode           | Undo           | C-z         |

*** Multiple cursors
Supported through https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el.
| Key     | Map                              | Reason/inspiration | Overrides   | Instead use |
|---------+----------------------------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------|
| C-d     | Select next occurrence of symbol | VScode             | Delete char | Delete      |
| M-Mouse | Place multiple cursor            | IntelliJ/VScode    |             |             |

** Window management
I think windmove is the sanest way to switch windows. It's not bound anywhere though...
other-window, delete-window, and delete-other-windows are also important, but don't have great keybindings by default.
| Key   | Map                                                | Overrides         |
|-------+----------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
| F9    | Other window                                       |                   |
| M-o   | Other window                                       | Something useless |
| F10   | Delete other windows                               |                   |
| S-Esc | keyboard escape quit (which deletes other windows) |                   |

** Buffer switching
I think modern editors have a few different buffer switchers:
- Tabs: ok for a few buffers, but do not scale well to many buffers
- C-Tab: single-press to switch buffers. Press again to switch further between the most recently used.
- C-e: search for buffer by name
Both VScode and IntelliJ have all of these. They're here too
| Key           | Map                 | Overrides                 |
|---------------+---------------------+---------------------------|
| C-F4          | Kill current buffer |                           |
| C-PgUp/Pgdn   | Next/previous tab   |                           |
| C-S-Pgup/pgdn | Rearrange tabs      |                           |
| C-e           | Switch buffer       | End - use End key instead |
| C-Tab         | Switch buffer       |                           |

** Files
C-o and C-s are rebound out of muscle memory and because the Emacs defaults are kind of awkward.
| Key   | Map                   | Reason/inspiration | Overrides | Instead use |
|-------+-----------------------+--------------------+-----------+-------------|
| C-o   | Open OR make new file | Many apps          | Open line | Enter, Left |
| C-s   | Save                  | Many apps          | Search    | C-f         |
| C-S-s | Save as               |                    |           |             |
| C-c r | Rename file           |                    |           |             |

** Projects
Projectile is used for poject management.
| Key   | Map                  | Inspiration     |
|-------+----------------------+-----------------|
| M-p   | Project menu         |                 |
| C-S-f | Search in project    | IntelliJ/Vscode |
| C-S-n | Find file in project | IntelliJ        |
