* Emacs config
The keybindings are kind of a compromise between Emacs and IntelliJ.

| M-Spc     | Set mark                     | More ergonomic than C-Spc | Just one space |             |
| C-w/C-S-w | Expand/contract region       | IntelliJ                  | Cut            | C-x         |
| F9        | Other window                 |                           |                |             |
| F10       | Make only window             |                           |                |             |
| C-e       | Switch buffer                | IntelliJ/VScode           | End of line    | End         |

| C-S-f     | Search in project            | IntelliJ/VScode           |                |             |
| C-S-n     | Find file in project         | IntelliJ                  |                |             |

General approach
- Cua mode
- Swiper for search, Ivy for completion
- Two buffer switchers: C-Tab switches in a single keychord. C-e to search for buffers.
- Projectile for project management
